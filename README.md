# 6G
The article discusses the development and implementation of 6G wireless communication technology, which is expected to be available by the 2030s. The focus of 6G will be to provide even higher data speeds, lower latency, and increased reliability in wireless communication. To achieve these goals, 6G will go beyond the current wireless communication system architecture concepts, and incorporate new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, terahertz communication, and new antenna structures. The paper also discusses the challenges faced in the development of terahertz communication and provides an overview of the key performance indicators (KPIs) that will change in 6G networks. Finally, the article highlights several launch issues that need to be addressed for the successful implementation and migration beyond 5G/6G networks.
